# Movie-Details-Comparison-Tool
I developed a dynamic web page with JavaScript to fetch movie details from an external API. It features two search bars for users to input movie names, allowing side-by-side comparisons of statistics like ratings, awards, and more. The project includes seamless API integration for real-time data retrieval and an interactive UI design.
